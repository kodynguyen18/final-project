## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Kody Nguyen, I am a junior at Mt.Eden High School who is learning about computer science from my goat Mr. Alvarado. I plan to go to UC San Diego after high school and I also work for YEP as a youth professional. I am a committed learner and am excited to see where my future takes me!

## 📚 About This Project

This project is the culmination of what I’ve learned over the course of the year as a student developer. It showcases my ability to design, build, and deploy a personal portfolio website from scratch. Through this process, I’ve learned how to use GitHub Pages for deployment, write more efficient and structured code, and design user-friendly layouts using CSS Grid and JavaScript interactivity.

## 🌐 Portfolio Site Overview

My portfolio site includes:

- A clean homepage with a short introduction
- An "About Me" section detailing my background and interests in development
- A featured project gallery built with JavaScript and CSS Grid
- Links to live projects and GitHub repositories
- A responsive design that works across different screen sizes

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

- **Pong Game**  
  This game was my first project for this class. I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to make the pong arcade game using strictly HTML and Java script.

- **Cookie Clicker**  
  This was the third project for this class and it was a group assignment. We were not allowed to follow any tutorials and had limited outside help. This game is a cookie clicker replica with ranks and upgrades like an autoclicker and double clicks, all created using HTML, CSS, and Java. Try it above!

- **Guess The Number Game**  
  This game was my final project for this class and was completed solo without outside help. I used HTML, CSS, and Java script to make this game and turned it into the College Board. When playing, there are two separate game modes: one where you can pick the secret number, and one where it is computer-generated. After you guess a random number from 1-100, it will tell you whether it is higher or lower until the correct number is submitted.
